    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a third-year PhD student in the IPRoBe Lab under the supervision of Dr. Arun Ross. With a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and a master’s in Mechanical Engineering,
       I bring a strong analytical and interdisciplinary perspective to my research. I have contributed to a variety of projects involving facial enhancement, video frame selection,
       and multimodal fusion of face and body biometric data. Currently, my work focuses on developing AI-based frameworks to support cosmetic surgery procedures, advancing facial aesthetics enhancement through innovative computational methods.</p>
